#react-decorate-fetch
A library to fetch data for React Components, which has most of the similar API with [react-refetch](https://github.com/heroku/react-refetch). Different, it also supports more friendly way to use, like Hooks.

## Installation
Supporting for react and react-native

```sh
npm i react-decorate-fetch --save
or
yarn add react-decorate-fetch
```
## Why I don't use react-refetch
`react-refetch` is a very awesome project,it  saved me a lot of time. I really like this way without setState to fetch data. Now, Hooks are growing in popularity, more projects use Hooks. So I write this library to supports Hooks, and Copy `react-refetch`'s API to compatible my old Projects.
##Example

```javascript
